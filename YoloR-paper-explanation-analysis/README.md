1. assests - Folder which contains single image and video for inference testing
2. updated_yolor_repo_files - This folder contains files to be used during code setup of YoloR.
3. Local_Setup_and_Run_Instructions.ipynb - This is the jupyter notebook that contains instructions on how to download and setup YoloR repository for performing inference on images and videos as shown in the blog post.
4. YoloR_Inference_Colab.ipynb - A ready to use inference notebook that you can run on Google colab without the hassle of local installation.

**You can run it on your local system or on Colab.**

* On Google Colab, all the requirements will be installed automatically. [Open Notebook on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/spmallick/learnopencv/blob/master/YoloR-paper-explanation-analysis/YoloR_Inference_Colab.ipynb)
* To run on local machine I would recommend you to consider this folder as the top-level directory and perform all operations as mentioned in the notebook (*Local_Setup_and_Run_Instructions.ipynb*) using this directory as the starting point.
